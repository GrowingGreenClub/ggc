    <li>PayFast is a payment gateway that provides a secure and convenient way for businesses to receive payments online. If you've recently purchased tickets to a concert through PayFast, you may need proof of payment to gain entry to the event.</li><br>
    <li>Once you have completed your payment, PayFast will send you an email confirmation that includes a detailed breakdown of the transaction, including the amount paid, the date and time of the transaction, and the payment method used. This confirmation serves as proof of payment and should be kept safe and readily accessible.</li><br>
    <li>To gain entrance to the concert, you will need to show the proof of payment at the gate. The concert organizers may require you to present a physical copy of the confirmation email, so it's a good idea to print it out and keep it with you. Alternatively, you can show the email on your smartphone or mobile device.</li><br>
    <li>It's important to note that the confirmation email from PayFast is only valid for the specific transaction it relates to. If you have purchased tickets for multiple events, each transaction will have its own confirmation email, and you will need to present the relevant email for the specific event you are attending.</li><br>
    <li>In summary, PayFast will send you a confirmation email with proof of payment after you complete a transaction for concert tickets. This email serves as proof of payment, which you will need to show at the gate to gain entry to the event. Be sure to keep the confirmation email safe and easily accessible, and present it either in print or on your mobile device when you arrive at the concert.</li><br>
